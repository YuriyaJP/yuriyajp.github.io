## About

I work with data to understand behavior, evaluate outcomes, and support better decisions.

My work typically involves:
- Framing ambiguous problems into answerable questions
- Designing and analyzing quantitative studies
- Interpreting results in context, not in isolation
- Communicating findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders

Across roles, I focus on work that is methodologically sound, practically useful, and responsibly applied.

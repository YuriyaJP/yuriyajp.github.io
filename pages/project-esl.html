    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project applies a deep learning–based natural language processing approach to analyze
        Japanese student feedback collected from project-based English classes. Using a pretrained
        Japanese BERT model, free-text responses were automatically classified into positive,
        negative, and neutral sentiment categories, enabling scalable and context-aware analysis of
        student perceptions.
    </p>

    <p>
        An earlier exploratory version of this project (2023) focused on morphological analysis and
        keyword extraction. In 2025, the project was reviewed and redesigned to focus specifically
        on sentiment analysis using a modern deep learning language model.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Timeline:</strong> 2025 (project revision)<br>
        <strong>Location:</strong> High School ESL Program, Japan<br>
        <strong>Dataset:</strong> 120+ anonymized student feedback responses<br>
        <strong>Language:</strong> Japanese
    </p>


    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <div class="summary-grid">

        <div class="summary-card">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Collection:</strong>
            Student feedback was collected via Google Forms following project-based learning
            activities across four curriculum units.
        </li>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-card">
        <li>
            <strong>Preprocessing:</strong>
            Responses were cleaned, anonymized, and standardized to prepare free-text Japanese input
            for model inference.
        </li>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-card">
        <li>
            <strong>Sentiment Classification:</strong>
            A pretrained Japanese BERT model was used to classify each response into
            positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories based on sentence-level context.
        </li>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-card">
        <li>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong>
            Sentiment distributions were aggregated by project type to identify patterns in student
            satisfaction and perceived difficulty.
        </li>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-card">
        <li>
            <strong>Visualization:</strong>
            Results were communicated using sentiment distribution charts and project-level
            comparisons to support instructional decision-making.

    <h2>Key Results & Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            📈 <strong>Clear sentiment trends identified</strong> across four project types using
            automated classification.
        </li>
        <li>
            ✅ <strong>Country Presentation project</strong> showed the highest proportion of
            positive sentiment, reflecting strong engagement with cultural content.
        </li>
        <li>
            ⚠️ <strong>Skit Festival project</strong> generated the largest share of negative
            sentiment, often linked to time pressure and performance anxiety.
        </li>
        <li>
            💡 <strong>Negative feedback analysis</strong> highlighted recurring concerns related
            to workload, preparation time, and task difficulty.
        </li>
        <li>
            🎯 <strong>Findings were used to support curriculum adjustments</strong>, including
            extended timelines and additional instructional scaffolding.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sentiment analysis revealed that student satisfaction correlated more strongly with task clarity, autonomy, and preparation support than with language difficulty. Creative group projects generated the highest engagement but required explicit scaffolding to mitigate anxiety, while individual research-based projects consistently produced positive sentiment due to clear structure and learner control.</p>

    <h2>Sample Analysis Output</h2>
    <div style="background:#f8f9fa; padding:20px; border-left:4px solid #667eea; border-radius:5px; margin:20px 0; font-family:monospace; font-size:0.9em;">
        <strong>Example Sentiment Distribution:</strong><br><br>
        Country Presentation → Positive-dominant<br>
        Demonstration Dialogue → Mixed sentiment<br>
        Skit Festival → Higher negative proportion<br>
        Summer Project → Mostly neutral to positive<br><br>
        <strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
        Performance-based tasks showed higher stress-related sentiment, while research-based
        projects promoted positive engagement.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This interactive visual novel applies evidence-based psycholinguistic principles to enhance English communication skills among Japanese high school students. By embedding language learning within familiar school environments and peer interactions, the game creates optimal conditions for natural language acquisition while reducing anxiety and increasing engagement.</p>

    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2022–2023 Academic Year<br>
    <strong>Location:</strong> Sogo High School, Chiba, Japan<br>
    <strong>Target Audience:</strong> High School Students (Ages 15-18)<br>
    <strong>Platform:</strong> Ren'Py (Python-based)</p>

    <h2>The Science Behind the Design</h2>
    <p>This project integrates four major psycholinguistic theories to create an optimal learning environment:</p>

    <h3>1. Willingness to Communicate (WTC) Theory</h3>
    <p>WTC measures a learner's readiness to speak in a second language during specific situations. Research shows that students communicate more when they feel comfortable with their conversation partner and environment.</p>
    <p><strong>How I Applied This:</strong> The game features same-age peer characters in familiar school settings. Students interact with both Japanese classmates and foreign exchange students, mirroring real social dynamics they already navigate daily. This familiarity increases their willingness to engage with English content.</p>

    <h3>2. Schema Theory & Familiar Contexts</h3>
    <p>Schema theory explains that we understand new information by connecting it to what we already know. When learning happens in familiar environments, students can focus on language rather than trying to understand the context.</p>
    <p><strong>How I Applied This:</strong> The game uses photos of the students' actual high school: their classrooms, hallways, gym, and nearby locations. Characters face situations students experience regularly: homework deadlines, club activities, after-school hangouts. This contextual familiarity allows them to dedicate mental energy to understanding English rather than decoding unfamiliar scenarios.</p>

    <h3>3. Krashen's Input Hypothesis (i+1)</h3>
    <p>Students acquire language best when they encounter content that's slightly above their current level-challenging enough to learn from but not so difficult that they feel lost. The "+1" represents that small stretch beyond comfort.</p>
    <p><strong>How I Applied This:</strong> Dialogue includes vocabulary and grammar students already know, plus new phrases they can understand from context. The branching story paths provide multiple exposures to key language patterns in different situations, allowing natural acquisition through meaningful repetition.</p>

    <h3>4. Affective Filter Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>Anxiety, stress, and fear create a mental "filter" that blocks language learning. When students feel anxious about making mistakes, their brain literally absorbs less information. Lowering this emotional barrier is crucial for acquisition.</p>
    <p><strong>How I Applied This:</strong> Game-based learning eliminates public speaking anxiety. Students can make choices privately, try different conversation paths, and "fail" without social consequences. The playful format and choice-driven narrative give students control, boosting confidence and motivation while keeping stress low.</p>

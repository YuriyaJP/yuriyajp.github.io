    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
    This project analyzes health-related narratives expressed in meal replacement product reviews 
    published on the YouTube video platform.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using video transcripts and accompanying metadata, I examine how automated analytical systems 
    interpret user-reported experiences such as digestion, taste, satiety, and perceived health effects, 
    and where those systems risk misclassification or overgeneralization.
    </p>

    <p>
    The emphasis is not on evaluating the truth of individual claims, but on identifying patterns, 
    failure modes, and potential harm amplification when consumer health narratives are processed 
    at scale by automated models.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Important Positioning</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Analyzes publicly available consumer video reviews only</li>
        <li>Does not provide medical, nutritional, or diagnostic advice</li>
        <li>Does not assess the clinical validity of health claims</li>
        <li>Focuses on risks in automated interpretation and aggregation</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Current Status</h2>

    <p>
    This is an ongoing, exploratory project. Current work focuses on transcript collection, 
    claim categorization, and early risk analysis of automated interpretation. 
    Further modeling and evaluation will be added iteratively.
